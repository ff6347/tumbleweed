# Tumbleweed

This is empty repl to see the basic building blocks of our projects. It includes a link to p5js on a cdn nothing more.

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

[Check out the official docs here](https://p5js.org/reference/).
